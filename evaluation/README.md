# Evaluation Framework

This directory contains CEFR-aligned assessment rubrics and can-do statements for evaluating Spanish language proficiency at A2 and B1 levels. These materials enable consistent, valid, and reliable assessment of learner performance across all language skills.

## Overview

The evaluation framework consists of:

1. **Analytic Rubrics**: Detailed scoring guides for speaking and writing
2. **CEFR Can-Do Mapping**: Comprehensive descriptors of what learners can do at each level
3. **Assessment Procedures**: Guidelines for valid and reliable evaluation

All materials are aligned with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and incorporate best practices in language assessment.

## Rubric Design Philosophy

### Analytic vs. Holistic

These rubrics use **analytic scoring** rather than holistic because:
- **Diagnostic value**: Identifies specific strengths and weaknesses
- **Feedback precision**: Enables targeted improvement
- **Reliability**: Multiple dimensions reduce subjectivity
- **Learning tool**: Helps learners understand assessment criteria

### Four/Five Dimensions

**Speaking Rubric** (4 dimensions):
Reflects the communicative competence model, balancing linguistic resources (Range, Accuracy) with performance factors (Fluency, Interaction).

**Writing Rubric** (5 dimensions):
Adds Task Achievement and Appropriateness to account for the planned, edited nature of writing and its purpose-driven character.

### 12-Point Scale

The 12-point scale maps to six performance levels within A2-B1:
- A2 Low (1-2)
- A2 Mid (3-4)
- A2 High (5-6)
- B1 Low (7-8)
- B1 Mid (9-10)
- B1 High (11-12)

This granularity enables:
- **Placement precision**: Distinguish learners within levels
- **Progress tracking**: Measure incremental improvement
- **Diagnostic utility**: Identify zone of proximal development

## Using the Rubrics

### Assessment Procedure

#### 1. Preparation
- Review CEFR descriptors for target level
- Familiarize yourself with rubric dimensions
- Prepare appropriate assessment tasks
- Ensure consistent conditions (time, resources, instructions)

#### 2. Data Collection

**For Speaking**:
- Plan 10-15 minute interaction
- Include varied task types (description, narration, opinion, interaction)
- Record session if possible
- Take notes on each dimension

**For Writing**:
- Provide clear task instructions
- Set appropriate word count (A2: 60-100 words; B1: 150-200 words)
- Allow adequate time (A2: 20-30 min; B1: 30-40 min)
- Specify audience, purpose, format

#### 3. Scoring Process
1. **Holistic impression**: Read/listen to entire performance first
2. **Dimension analysis**: Score each dimension independently
3. **Half-points**: Use for performances between descriptors
4. **Score review**: Check for consistency across dimensions
5. **Calculate total**: Apply weights and sum
6. **Assign level**: Map total score to CEFR level

#### 4. Feedback Provision
- Provide scores for each dimension
- Give specific examples from performance
- Highlight strengths
- Identify 2-3 priorities for improvement
- Offer concrete next steps

### Task Selection

Assessment tasks must be:
- **Level-appropriate**: Neither too easy nor too difficult
- **Authentic**: Reflect real-world language use
- **Clear**: Instructions and expectations explicit
- **Relevant**: Connect to learner interests and needs
- **Valid**: Actually test what they claim to test

#### Speaking Task Types

**A2 Appropriate**:
- Describing daily routine or familiar activities
- Talking about past experiences (simple events)
- Expressing preferences with reasons
- Simple transactional role-plays (shopping, restaurant)
- Describing people, places, things

**B1 Appropriate**:
- Narrating past experiences with detail
- Expressing and justifying opinions on abstract topics
- Comparing and contrasting options
- Hypothetical situations (conditional)
- Problem-solving discussions
- Presenting information on familiar topics

#### Writing Task Types

**A2 Appropriate**:
- Informal email to friend (60-80 words)

### Interpreting Scores

#### Total Score Ranges

| Score Range | CEFR Level | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 1.0 - 3.0 | A2 Low | Below or very low A2; needs significant development |
| 3.1 - 5.0 | A2 Mid | Solid A2 performance; typical A2 learner |
| 5.1 - 6.5 | A2 High | Strong A2, approaching B1; ready for B1 challenges |
| 6.6 - 8.5 | B1 Low | Emerging B1; crossed threshold but inconsistent |
| 8.6 - 10.5 | B1 Mid | Solid B1 performance; typical B1 learner |
| 10.6 - 12.0 | B1 High | Strong B1, approaching B2; ready for upper-intermediate |

#### Dimension Profiles

Look for patterns across dimensions:

**Balanced profile** (all dimensions similar):
Indicates consistent development across competencies

**Unbalanced profile** (dimensions vary >2 points):
Indicates specific strengths/weaknesses; target lowest dimensions

**Common patterns**:
- High Accuracy, Low Fluency: Careful, hesitant speakers; encourage fluency over accuracy
- High Range, Low Accuracy: Ambitious but error-prone; focus on consolidation
- High Interaction, Low Range: Socially competent but linguistically limited; expand vocabulary
- High Task/Coherence, Low Range/Accuracy: Good organizational skills but limited language

## CEFR Can-Do Statements

The `cefr-can-do-mapping.yaml` file provides:

### Skill-Specific Descriptors

For each main skill (speaking, listening, reading, writing), descriptors are organized by:
- **Activity type** (e.g., conversation, presentations, correspondence)
- **CEFR level** (A2, B1)
- **Can-do statements**: Specific things learners can do
- **Spanish examples**: Concrete language samples

### Using Can-Do Statements

#### 1. Needs Analysis
Identify which can-do statements are most relevant to learner goals

#### 2. Placement
Determine current level by checking which statements learner can perform

#### 3. Goal Setting
Select target can-do statements for upcoming learning phase

#### 4. Progress Tracking
Regularly assess which new statements learner can perform

#### 5. Self-Assessment
Have learners evaluate their own abilities against statements

#### 6. Portfolio Development
Collect evidence of ability to perform various can-dos

### Can-Do Categories

#### Speaking Production
- Sustained monologue (describing, narrating)
- Addressing audiences (presentations, talks)

#### Speaking Interaction
- General conversation
- Informal conversation with friends
- Formal exchanges (transactions, services)
- Information exchange

#### Listening
- Understanding conversations among native speakers
- Listening to audio media (radio, podcasts, announcements)

#### Reading
- General comprehension
- Correspondence (letters, emails)
- Reading for information (brochures, articles, instructions)

#### Writing
- Creative writing (descriptions, narratives)
- Correspondence (personal and formal letters, emails)
- Reports and essays

## Progression from A2 to B1

Understanding the A2→B1 transition helps target instruction:

### Key Developments

**Topical Range**: Concrete familiar topics → Abstract general topics

**Linguistic Resources**:
- Grammar: Simple structures → Complex subordination, subjunctive, conditional
- Vocabulary: High-frequency everyday → Wide general range with specialization

**Discourse Management**:
- Speaking: Short exchanges → Extended conversation
- Writing: Simple connected text → Coherent organized discourse

**Strategic Competence**:
- Repair: Relies on interlocutor → More autonomous
- Circumlocution: Limited → Effective paraphrasing

**Independence**:
- Communication: Needs support → Can cope independently
- Context: Predictable situations → Handles unpredictable

### Linguistic Markers

The presence of these features suggests B1 level:
- Consistent subjunctive use
- Complex conditional sentences
- Sophisticated connectors (sin embargo, por lo tanto, mientras que)
- Subordinate clauses (aunque, a pesar de que, para que)
- Extended discourse (multi-paragraph texts, sustained speech)
- Opinion expression with elaborated justification
- Narrative with sequencing and detail

## Error Analysis

Rubrics enable systematic error analysis:

### A2 Typical Errors
- Gender/number agreement inconsistencies
- Ser/estar confusion
- Irregular verb conjugation errors
- Missing or incorrect articles
- Simple tense errors

**Impact**: May occasionally impede comprehension

### B1 Typical Errors
- Inconsistent subjunctive use
- Por/para confusion
- Complex tense errors (pluperfect, conditional perfect)
- Subtle agreement lapses

**Impact**: Rarely impede comprehension

### Using Error Analysis

1. **Pattern identification**: What errors occur consistently?
2. **Developmental stage**: Are these appropriate for level?
3. **Priority setting**: Which errors most affect communication?
4. **Instructional planning**: What focused instruction is needed?
5. **Progress monitoring**: Are errors decreasing over time?
